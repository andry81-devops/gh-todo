* Implement push-pull retry loop to make a git repo push from different
  workflow pipelines.

  for:

    /gh-action--*
    /gh-workflow

* Implement a github repo statistic push from different repos into a single git
  repo to avoid github repositories page overrun by the automated user commits
  (page updates each time a commit is made).

  for:

    /github-accum-stats
    /gh-action--*
    /gh-workflow

* Implement a repository release downloads accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-repo-release-downloads
      /gh-workflow

* Implement a repository subscribers accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-repo-subscribers
      /gh-workflow

* Implement a repository stargazers accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-repo-stargazers
      /gh-workflow

* Implement an account followers accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-account-followers
      /gh-workflow

* Implement a new tag watcher GitHub action experimental script to watch an
  arbitrary git repository for a tag creation by a name pattern and does
  reflect it as a release tag creation in another git repository to be able to
  notify the owner about each tag creation.
  Can be used for repositories where the owner does not make release but
  instead does make tags.

* Implement a repository events accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-repo-events
      /gh-workflow

* Implement per date commit message to indicate particular statistic for a date
  in a file or directory. For example, the `by_year` directory does contain
  files in format `YYYY-MM-DD.json`. Each that file can be committed separately
  with different commit message to indicate different accumulation statistic
  segmented by date.

    for:

      /gh-workflow
