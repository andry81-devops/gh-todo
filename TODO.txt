* Implement push-pull retry loop to make a git repo push from different
  workflow pipelines.

  for:

    /gh-action--*
    /gh-workflow

* Implement a github repo statistic push from different repos into a single git
  repo to avoid github repositories page overrun by the automated user commits
  (page updates each time a commit is made).

  for:

    /github-accum-stats
    /gh-action--*
    /gh-workflow

* Workflow scripts to get, store and update various content like
  badges, stickers, json files and so on through a git repository.
  Reason: To make them always online (for example, in README.md files from
  other git repositories) as long as a content cache repo is online.

  for:

    /gh-action--content-cache
      - to store action scripts
    /gh-workflow
      - to store shell scripts

    /<repo>--gh-content-cache
      - Repo to store content files for <repo>
    /gh-content-cache
      - repo to store content files for all repos

    /<repo>--gh-content-cache-config
    /gh-content-cache-config
      - configs for related content cache repos

  /<repo>--gh-content-cache and gh-content-cache can be rewrited and purged to
  drop the history out and should store only content cache not other files like
  configs or metadata.

* Implement a repository subscribers accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-repo-subscribers
      /gh-workflow

* Implement a repository stargazers accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-repo-stargazers
      /gh-workflow

* Implement an account followers accumulator.

    for:

      /github-accum-stats
      /gh-action--accum-account-followers
      /gh-workflow
